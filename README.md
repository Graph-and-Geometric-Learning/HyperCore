# HyperCore

**HyperCore** is a library built upon PyTorch to easily write and train hyperbolic foundation models for a wide range of applications in diverse modalities. [PAPER LINK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08912)

We provide the core modules and functionalities that makes this process simple for users of all levels of backgrounds in differential geometry. These include methods and algorithms for hyperbolic neural networks and foundation models, optimization techiniques, and manifold operations. These come together to enable intuitive constructions of hyperbolic foundation models architectures and pipelines, e.g. [hyperbolic Transformer](example_usage/Hyperbolic_Transformers/lorentz_transformer.py), [hyperbolic ViT](example_usage/Hyperbolic_Transformers/vision_transformer.py), [hyperbolic fine-tuning](example_usage/Fine-Tuning/fine_tuning_example.py), [hyperbolic GraphRAG](example_usage/Hyperbolic_GraphRAG/graphRAG_example.py) and more (see our paper and tutorials below!).
